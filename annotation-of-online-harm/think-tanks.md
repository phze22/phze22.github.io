##### Think Tanks for Annotating Online Harm

Think tanks are known as research institutes, gathering experts around one topic and operating usually as non-governmental organizations.

Referring to their existence idea of gathering inter-disciplinary work circled strongly around one topic but in their existence next to academia as a servant for preparing information in a ready-to-use format for decision-makers (by making them publicly available), we want to use this concept in targeting the question: 
**Where and how to implement interdisciplinary work within the annotation process of online harm?**


In the paper *An IDR Framework of Opportunities and Barriers between HCI and NLP*, the authors Nanna Inie and Leon Derczynski, which are also the co-authors of *Annotating Online Misogyny* present an IDR (interdisciplinary research-model) for the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as a deaprture point for discussion and inspiration for research collaborations. One part of their objectives is the Annotation process.



As part of my talk in the Gender in Research group, I would like to take their points as a common discussion base for creating a think tank around the annotation process of online harm between the audience of researchers and students from humanitis, cognitive and osychologist, and some of them with a research focus on gender/ sexuality and feminist theories and NLP.

The discussion questions are:
1. 
1. Who should be the facilitator?
2. How to train annotators?
3. How 
4. 
5. How to manage disagreement discussions of annotators?
